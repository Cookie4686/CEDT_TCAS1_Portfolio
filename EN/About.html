      <h2 class="center">Why did I create this Website?</h2>
      <p class="easyRead"><span class="tab"></span>In Grade 11 (when I&rsquo;m 17 years old) I heard the idea that says “If you are going to make a portfolio to enroll in the computing field then make a website version of it”. At first I wasn&rsquo;t sure about making one but when I&rsquo;m in Grade 12 I have decided that I will enroll in the CEDT curriculum but I know that I don't have any flashy awards to actually get accepted,  at that moment I thought about that idea and started making this website in June 2023 to prove my motivation and my skills. I hope that this website will help increase my odds of passing this round, so that I could spend my time doing other side projects that I am interested in.</p>

      <h2 class="center">Creating the Website</h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>This  static Web Page was created by using HTML CSS and JS and I didn't use any framework or AI, because I want to practice the basics first. My motto for creating this website is "Simple yet Elegant" which means that I will try to keep it simple like how the minimalism style is, mainly because I haven't gotten enough web dev skills yet. Finally this website took me around 4 months to complete which I have explained more in detail below.</p>
      <p><span class="bold tab">Late June-July</span><br>In the first phase of making the website, I haven't got any content or specific website layout so I started making a simple responsive navigation bar which is a top nav on PC and side nav on mobile with a open/closing button. And I also created the header section which includes a welcome message and the curriculum like in A4 Portfolio.</p>
      <p><span class="bold tab">August</span><br>In August I tried to make my code more readable. Add more sections like the introduction, education background and my skills. I also add animations when users scroll down too (but I removed this later on).</p>
      <p><span class="bold tab">September</span><br>In September I thought that the navbar I created last month was too bland and boring, so I added darkmode and logo to it, and I also changed the navbar in mobile from sidenav to full screen instead.</p>
      <p><span class="bold tab">Early October</span><br>This period is the school holiday which means I have more time to develop the website. I have also done an A4 portfolio to some extent already. So I started to plan the website layout like in the A4 version and focused more on the planning process like noting what to do and preparing the file path for real website publishing.</p>
      <p><span class="bold tab">Middle of October</span><br>On 18th of October the requirements for CEDT came out, so I changed my A4 portfolio to meet the requirements and prepare the content that I will use in my website. And the school holiday is also coming to an end so I planned that I would do the important part of the website first and the other additional part would be cut out.</p>
      <p><span class="bold tab">Late October-November</span><br>In the final phase where the deadline is coming close I have tested publishing the website, prepared the content in both the website and in A4 portfolio and I also translated the website content into English.</p>
