**-2024 notes**

This is an old and probably embarrassing project (a very spaghetti code and lots of weird things)
Back then I didn't know how git works, what is frameworks, no experiences. I just started fresh.
I tried to learn web development in a short time span in hopes of getting into the university earlier.
But it didn't go well.


Still, I make it into the university in another round (very close one).
I thought of making this private in order to use this Github profile for an internship,
but I wanted to show the beginnings of my journey.
So enjoy the pain that this website gives ðŸ˜„.

---------------Old Log------------------


Hello, I'm Sivaphat. Nice to see you here.

I am a Web Dev beginner and this github respository is for publishing my Portfolio.

Feel free to explore the website and source code.

If you have any recommendations you can contact me directly at cookieandcake1105@gmail.com .

Thank You and Have Fun. â™¥

**Note 25/11/2023**

The Website isn't to the point where I imagine it to be but there won't be any updates or major changes to it, because of
1. I have started to work on new project (IoT Web App Svelte+Tailwind+Firebase)
2. I might got screen out already (395 screen out to around 300 of which meet the criteria)
3. I am in boarding school that restricts smartphone/laptop usage which make me didn't have much time to do lots of things.

**Update 26/12/2023**

I got rejected (yeah I know that this would eventually happened) so that will conclude this website's journey.

**What will I do next**

Try enrolling into KMUTT or wait for Admission round.

I don't know yet, I still like this CEDT curriculum ðŸ˜”.
